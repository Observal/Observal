# Pi

Pi is a first-class Observal harness integration. Observal can install Pi agent
profiles, configure MCP servers, expose skills, install the telemetry extension,
and collect Pi session telemetry.

---

## Overview

Pi is harness-centric: the whole of Pi is one agent. There is no per-agent
profile file the way Kiro or OpenCode have one. Instead, Observal writes the
agent's rules into `AGENTS.md`, which becomes Pi's system prompt, and writes
MCP servers and skills next to it.

To let several registry agents coexist, a user-scope `observal agent pull`
writes each agent into its own profile directory under
`~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent}/`. The Observal extension's `/agent` command swaps a
profile into the live `~/.pi/agent/` location. A project-scope pull writes the
rules straight to the project's `AGENTS.md`, which Pi reads directly.

Pi session telemetry uses an in-process TypeScript extension,
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/observal.ts`. It is installed by `observal doctor patch`
and is shared by every agent; agent pulls do not embed telemetry hooks.

---

## Supported capabilities

| Capability | Support |
|---|---|
| Agent profiles | Project and user scope, as `AGENTS.md` |
| Hook bridge | Pi extension (no shell hooks) |
| Extension events | `session_start`, `agent_end`, `session_shutdown` |
| MCP servers | Active `.pi/mcp-adapter.json` / `~/.pi/agent/mcp-adapter.json` for adapter 3.x; `mcp.json` for adapter 2.x or Pi built-in MCP |
| Agent prompt | Registry rules are written into the generated `AGENTS.md` |
| Guidance files | Scanned from `AGENTS.md`, `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`, `.pi/SYSTEM.md`, `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` |
| Skills | `.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` and `~/.pi/agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Session parsing | Pi JSONL parser, including result-linked MCP invocation extraction |
| MCP component insights | Observed calls for verified, uniquely matched MCP servers with `pi-mcp-adapter`; otherwise coverage reports unavailable attribution, not zero use |
| Telemetry | Pi session transcripts delivered through the extension; `observal reconcile --harness pi` is accepted but finds no sessions |
| Model selection | Registry-backed Pi model catalog (`observal registry models list --harness pi`) |

---

## Setup

### 1. Install the Observal CLI

```bash
uv tool install observal-cli
# or: pipx install observal-cli
```

Pi 0.74.0 or newer is required by the telemetry extension.

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
observal auth login
```

This writes credentials to `~/.observal/config.json`. Unless you pass
`--no-setup` or `--output json`, login then installs the bundled Observal skills
into every detected harness (Pi counts once `~/.pi/` exists) and runs
`observal doctor`, which warns if the Pi telemetry extension is missing or
stale. A healthy install prints no Pi warning.

### 3. Pull an agent into Pi

```bash
observal agent pull <agent-name> --harness pi
```

Pi's default scope is user scope. The agent is written to
`~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent-name}/`.

To install into the current project:

```bash
observal agent pull <agent-name> --harness pi --scope project
```

Project pulls write the rules to `AGENTS.md` in the project root, which Pi
reads directly, and the agent's MCP servers and skills to
`.pi/agents/{agent-name}/`. `/agent` handles only user-scope profiles, so
activate a project profile explicitly. With `pi-mcp-adapter` 3.x, copy its
MCP config to the path that adapter actually loads:

```bash
cp .pi/agents/<agent-name>/mcp.json .pi/mcp-adapter.json
cp -r .pi/agents/<agent-name>/skills/. .pi/skills/
```

With adapter 2.x, use `.pi/mcp.json` instead. Merge rather than overwrite if
the active file already lists other servers. Pi releases with built-in MCP
support can also read `mcp.json`, but adapter-specific result attribution
requires a working adapter; do not assume the two MCP runtimes are equivalent.

### 4. Install or refresh the telemetry extension

```bash
observal doctor patch --harness pi
```

This writes the bundled extension to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/observal.ts` when
it is missing, and refreshes a copy Observal recognises as its own when that
copy has fallen behind or been edited, recording the CLI version it came from
in an adjacent `.observal-extension.json`. A file Observal did not write is
reported and left alone.

If `npm:observal-pi` is registered in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, that takes
precedence: nothing is installed locally, and a local copy Observal recognises
as its own is removed (kept as `observal.ts.bak`) so Pi does not load the
extension twice. A local file Observal did not write is left alone. Restart Pi
or run `/reload` afterwards.

`doctor patch` refuses to run until `observal auth login` has written a server
URL, although it does not contact the server.

### 5. Activate the agent inside Pi

Inside a Pi session, run `/agent` and pick the pulled agent. See
[Agent profiles and swapping](#agent-profiles-and-swapping).

### 6. Check what is installed

```bash
observal scan --harness pi
observal doctor
```

## Config paths

| Purpose | Project scope | User scope |
|---|---|---|
| Agent rules | `AGENTS.md` (project root) | `~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent}/AGENTS.md` |
| MCP config | `.pi/agents/{agent}/mcp.json` | `~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent}/mcp.json` |
| Skill definition | `.pi/agents/{agent}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | `~/.pi/agent/agents/{agent}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Active agent rules | `AGENTS.md` | `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` |
| Active MCP config | `.pi/mcp-adapter.json` (adapter 3.x), `.pi/mcp.json` (2.x) | `~/.pi/agent/mcp-adapter.json` (adapter 3.x), `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` (2.x) |
| Active skills | `.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | `~/.pi/agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Guidance files | `AGENTS.md`, `.pi/SYSTEM.md`, `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` | `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` |
| Telemetry extension | – | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/observal.ts` |
| Pi settings | – | `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` |
| Observal credentials | `~/.observal/config.json` | `~/.observal/config.json` |
| Observal lockfile | `~/.observal/lockfile.json` | `~/.observal/lockfile.json` |
| Acknowledged cursors | `~/.observal/sync_state.json` | `~/.observal/sync_state.json` |
| Pending batches | `~/.observal/pi_session_outbox/` | `~/.observal/pi_session_outbox/` |

Pi MCP configs use the `mcpServers` key.

### MCP component insights

Pi MCP support varies by Pi version. Install and configure `pi-mcp-adapter`
for the adapter-specific result identities verified by component insights;
its 2.x releases read active `mcp.json` and its 3.x releases read active
`mcp-adapter.json`. Pulling an agent records an MCP-entry
fingerprint from the generated profile, but **does not activate that profile**:
use `/agent` or activate the project config before starting the session. Refresh
the Observal extension with `observal doctor patch --harness pi` and restart Pi.

The extension fingerprints the active MCP entries, checks for conflicting
definitions and unresolved imports, and sends verification status per pinned
server. MCP config contents and credentials are never uploaded: these files are
hash-only snapshot inputs. A verifier-versioned synthetic hash-only manifest
entry binds pinned fingerprints to the layer identity, so a changed install
fingerprint cannot reuse an older snapshot's verification result. Legacy pulls
without fingerprints remain unverified until pulled again.

The server links Pi assistant tool calls to their results by unique tool-call
ID. For supported adapter result shapes, it reads only the reported server,
call mode, tool name and success/error state; it does not retain prompts, tool
arguments, result bodies, or credentials in activity rows. A call contributes
to a component only when the reported server exactly matches **one verified
installed alias** in that session's layer. Calls without a trustworthy link or
verified mapping remain unattributed. Agent-level attribution and MCP component
attribution are separate; the latter is visible in the MCP's activity summary
and session list for authorized owners. Other component types do not gain
observed-call reports from this integration.

This is fixture-verified for `pi-mcp-adapter` 2.38.0, with relevant result
shapes checked against 3.2.0. An adapter that changes its result details or
config resolution needs new sanitized fixtures and extractor verification
before its calls can be treated as measured use. Existing session hashes are
sender-cached; changes **during** a session cannot be proven stable, and
historical sessions without verified layer snapshots cannot be retroactively
attributed.

### Skill component insights

Skills have their own evidence, separate from MCP calls:

- **Verified presence.** A pull fingerprints each `SKILL.md` it writes. A session snapshot reports the skill as verified only when the active file Pi loads (`~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, or `.pi/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in a project) matches that fingerprint and no same-named skill exists where Pi could load it instead, such as `~/.agents/skills`. A skill that is installed but not yet activated with `/agent` is unverified, not drifted.
- **Available.** The session advertised the skill to the model.
- **Confirmed load.** The model read the skill's `SKILL.md` and the read succeeded. A failed or unlinked read is reported as a load attempt, not a load.
- **Not counted: `/skill:<name>`.** Pi stores the expanded command as an ordinary user message, which the same text typed or pasted by a user would reproduce, so Pi sessions never report invocations. When the model then reads the skill file, that read counts as a load.

Evidence is tied to the exact file that was verified. The verifier records a SHA-256 of the absolute `SKILL.md` path it fingerprinted, and a session's skill evidence is attributed only when the location Pi recorded hashes to the same value. A same-named skill under another directory, such as another user's `.pi/agent/skills`, is not counted. A custom `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is not yet followed by the verifier, so skills there are not counted.

Counts cover only verified-present skills. Pi and Claude Code record different evidence (see [Component insights](../cli/ops.md#component-insights)); other harnesses report skill evidence as `unsupported`. A confirmed load or an invocation shows that the skill's instructions entered the model's context. It does not show that the skill was followed or helped. Component reports for skills are deterministic and include no model-written findings.

## Agent profiles and swapping

Because Pi reads one active `AGENTS.md` and `skills/` directory, and the MCP
adapter reads one active profile config, only one Observal agent can be active
at a time. In user scope,
`observal agent pull` does not touch the active files. It writes into the
per-agent profile directory, and the extension's `/agent` command makes a
profile active:

1. On first use, `/agent` backs up the current `AGENTS.md`, `SYSTEM.md`,
   both MCP paths (when present), `skills/`, and `sandboxes/` into
   `~/.pi/agent/agents/default/`. An older default backup gains its missing
   adapter config once, before any swap removes it.
2. For adapter 3.x it activates the generated profile `mcp.json` **only** at
   `mcp-adapter.json`; adapter 2.x uses `mcp.json`. It never writes both active
   MCP paths for a selected agent, which could start the same server twice under built-in MCP
   and the adapter. Conflicting MCP configs inside a profile are rejected
   before changing the active files. `default` restores exactly the backed-up
   files, including both MCP paths when they originally existed.
3. It stages the old files and asks for confirmation. Before switching it
   tries to deliver the current session's unsent telemetry under the *old*
   agent. If delivery fails, declining the separate discard prompt preserves
   the pending batch and leaves the active files unchanged. Accepting it
   permanently discards that batch and stops uploading this conversation.
   After reload, the new runtime checks the active-file hash and uploads its
   snapshot before recording `active_agent`. If reload fails, it attempts to
   restore the old files and keeps attribution unverified until recovery.
   If Observal is unavailable or the user is logged out, local profile
   switching still works; an offline marker blocks attribution until a later
   session verifies the active files, uploads the snapshot, and records the
   agent binding. Other local profile switches remain available while offline.
4. **Start a new Pi session after switching.** The switching transcript can
   contain calls from both runtimes. Once the switch starts, its remaining
   lines are not uploaded (including on a later resume): the server's session
   summary otherwise could assign the old layer hash to new calls. Lines
   delivered before the switch keep their previous attribution. Only a new
   session receives the new binding and layer hash. A small marker under
   `~/.observal/pi_agent_switch_sessions/` prevents later uploads from the
   switching transcript. An interrupted switch is recorded in
   `~/.observal/pi_agent_switch_pending.json`; restart Pi to retry
   verification, or inspect the marker and restore the staged files manually
   if verification continues to fail. `pi_agent_switch_offline.json` records
   an accepted local switch awaiting server verification; it does not block
   switching profiles offline. Do not delete either marker to force
   attribution without checking which files and MCP runtime Pi loaded.

Run `/agent` with no argument to pick from installed profiles, or
`/agent <name>` to swap directly. Choose `default` to restore the backed-up
configuration and clear the active agent. `/agent` lists only user-scope
profiles under `~/.pi/agent/agents/`.

---

## Extension spec

Observal installs a TypeScript extension named `observal.ts`. It has no
runtime dependencies beyond `node:*` built-ins and is fail-open: telemetry
failures never interrupt Pi. Ingest and checkpoint calls time out after five
seconds, and the layer-snapshot upload after ten.

| Pi event | Observal use |
|---|---|
| `session_start` | Load config and cursors, upload the layer snapshot, recover stale sessions on startup, show `● observal` in the footer |
| `agent_end` | Push new session lines after each turn |
| `session_shutdown` | Push remaining lines and finalize the session |

The extension also registers two commands, `/agent` and `/obs-sync`:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/agent [name]` | Swap the active Observal agent profile |
| `/obs-sync` | Show lines pushed and the server URL |
| `/obs-sync flush` | Push pending lines now |
| `/obs-sync config` | Show the config file path and server URL |

`doctor patch` compares the installed file with the bundled source and replaces
stale copies.

## Attribution

Pi does not expose an Observal agent id in its session file. The extension
resolves attribution from Observal's own state:

1. `observal agent pull` records the agent name, id, version, scope, pull
   time, and directory under the `pi` harness in `~/.observal/lockfile.json`.
2. The pull also records that agent as `active_agent` in
   `~/.observal/config.json`, and `/agent` updates the entry whenever you
   swap profiles.
3. On `session_start`, the extension reads `active_agent` and looks it up in
   the lockfile entry for the configured server URL, matching by id first and
   then by name.
4. The session payload is sent with the resolved `agent_id` and
   `agent_version`.
5. If there is no `active_agent`, or it has no `id`, the session is sent with
   a null agent id.
   If there is an `active_agent` but no lockfile match, the stored id is sent
   as-is; no directory-based guessing takes place.

---

## Session push behavior

The Pi extension implements the same acknowledged delivery contract as the
Python harnesses:

1. Resolve the session JSONL file and id from Pi's session manager.
2. Read complete records after the acknowledged byte and line cursor in
   `~/.observal/sync_state.json`.
3. Persist each pending batch under `~/.observal/pi_session_outbox/` before
   network delivery, in chunks of at most 500 lines.
4. Retry the batch idempotently until the server returns a contiguous
   acknowledgement covering it.
5. Advance the local cursor only to that acknowledged checkpoint.
6. On `session_shutdown`, send a SHA-256 audit manifest and replay any range
   the server asks to repair.
7. On the next startup, retry every pending outbox batch, then re-push
   unfinished sessions from the current project that changed within the last
   seven days until five have been finalized. Attempts that fail do not count
   toward the five. A missing or corrupt cursor is rebuilt from the server
   checkpoint on the next push.

Pi's pending batches are the files under `~/.observal/pi_session_outbox/`.
`observal ops telemetry status` reports server ingest health and the Python
exporters' outbox; it does not count this directory.

---

## Agent profile format

Observal writes the agent's rules as plain Markdown into `AGENTS.md`. Pi loads
that file as the system prompt, so the whole file is the agent:

```markdown
# Reviewer

You are a code reviewer with the following specialization...
```

There is no frontmatter and no model field. `observal agent pull` does not
write a model into Pi's configuration; the model is chosen inside Pi.

---

## Skill file format

Pi skills live at:

| Scope | Path |
|---|---|
| Project | `.pi/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| User | `~/.pi/agent/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |

Example:

```markdown
---
description: "Runs the project test suite"
---

# Run Tests

Run `pytest -q` from the project root.
```

When Codex is also installed, the bundled Observal skills are written once to
the shared `~/.agents/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` location, which both harnesses
read, instead of being duplicated under `~/.pi/agent/skills/`.

---

## Caveats

**One active agent at a time.** A user-scope pull does not activate the
agent. Run `/agent` inside Pi, or copy the profile into `~/.pi/agent/` by hand.
`/agent` does not see project-scope profiles under `.pi/agents/`; copy their
`mcp.json` and `skills/` into `.pi/` as shown in Setup step 3.

**`/agent` replaces the active files.** The first swap backs up your existing
`AGENTS.md`, `SYSTEM.md`, both MCP configs if present, `skills/`, and
`sandboxes/` into the `default` profile. Later swaps install only what the
chosen profile contains, so a profile without `SYSTEM.md` leaves Pi with no
`SYSTEM.md`. Edit the profile directory, not the active files, if you want
changes to survive a swap. `/agent` detects an installed `pi-mcp-adapter` 2.x
or 3.x from Pi's managed npm package manifest; it **does not** guess from the
presence of `mcp.json` or `mcp-adapter.json`. If the adapter was installed
manually or its version cannot be identified, set `pi_mcp_runtime` to
`"adapter3"` (or `"adapter2"`) explicitly in `~/.observal/config.json` before
switching. For intentional Pi built-in MCP use, set it to `"builtin"`; this
activates `mcp.json` but **cannot** establish adapter-specific observed-call
attribution. An invalid or unknown runtime refuses the switch
without changing active files. Verify the override matches the MCP extension
actually loaded by Pi; an installed package alone is not proof it was enabled.

**The extension is shared per Pi install.** It is installed by `doctor patch`,
not by each agent pull, and lives only in user scope.

**Guidance files are scanned, with two exceptions.** Observal layers
`AGENTS.md`, `.pi/SYSTEM.md`, and `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` as context. Scanning
and `observal agent pull` never rewrite the project's `.pi/SYSTEM.md` or
`.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. A project-scope pull does write the project's
`AGENTS.md`, because that file is the agent's rules in Pi, and `/agent` swaps
do replace the user-scope `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md` as described above.

**Attribution depends on the lockfile and `/agent`.** A profile copied by hand
does not update `active_agent`, so its sessions keep whatever binding
`~/.observal/config.json` already holds, or carry no agent id if it has none.

**MCP config is Pi-specific.** Generated profiles use `mcp.json` with the
`mcpServers` key. Adapter 3.x loads the active `mcp-adapter.json`; adapter 2.x
loads active `mcp.json`. Neither uses Claude Code or Kiro MCP paths.
