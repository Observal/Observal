# Setup guide

Connect your machine to Observal with two commands. It takes about two minutes and does not need Python or Docker.

## 1. Run the two commands for your OS

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Observal/Observal/main/install.sh | bash
observal auth login --server https://internal.observal.io
```

**Windows** (in PowerShell, not Command Prompt)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Observal/Observal/main/install.ps1 | iex
observal auth login --server https://internal.observal.io
```

The first command installs the `observal` CLI. The second connects it to the server.

## 2. Answer the login prompts

1. **Login method**: pick the one your team uses. If unsure, choose **Web sign-in** and approve the code in your browser.
2. **`Fix all warnings? (configures telemetry and installs AI skills for detected harnesses) [Y/n]`**: answer **Y** (or press Enter).

   This is the step that instruments your coding tools. For each one Observal finds (Claude Code, Cursor, Kiro, Codex, Copilot, OpenCode, Pi, and others), it:

   * adds the hooks that send your sessions to Observal
   * installs the Observal skills, so your coding agent can search and use approved agents, MCP servers, and skills

   If you answer **n**, nothing is instrumented and your sessions won't show up. You can fix that later with `observal doctor patch --all-harnesses`.

3. Restart any coding tool that was open during setup so it picks up the changes.

## 3. Check it worked

```bash
observal auth whoami
```

Then open [internal.observal.io](https://internal.observal.io). Your sessions appear under Traces after your next coding session.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `observal: command not found` | Open a new terminal window. On macOS/Linux, also check that `/usr/local/bin` is on your `PATH`. |
| Intel Mac: download fails | There is no standalone binary for Intel Macs yet. Run `uv tool install observal-cli` instead of the first command. |
| PowerShell refuses to run `irm ... \| iex` | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass` in the same window, then retry. |
| Login can't reach the server | Check that you're on the VPN, then run `curl https://internal.observal.io/health`. |
| Answered **n** to the prompt, or added a new coding tool later | Run `observal doctor patch --all-harnesses`. |

To upgrade later, run `observal self upgrade`.
