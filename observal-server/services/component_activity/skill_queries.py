"""Owner-facing skill evidence reads over the published projections.

Mirrors the MCP activity reads but never shares their meaning: rows are
``evidence_kind LIKE 'skill_%'`` from the latest complete, non-failed
``evidence_type = 'skill'`` publication of each scoped session. Every read
starts from the shared verified-presence cohort and binds project, user,
harness and session. MCP call totals, coverage and model evidence never read
skill rows, and a complete MCP publication says nothing about skill coverage.
