"""The events that produce inbox items.

Review is not one choke point. Decisions land in seven endpoints across
``api/routes/review.py``, and a review can be requested from every submit and
publish path plus the visibility flip in
``teamspace.review_publication_to_public``. Every one of them calls a helper
here rather than assembling a delivery of its own, so the recipient rule, the
title and the dedupe key are decided once.

Auto-approved publishes deliberately emit nothing: a team owner publishing
team-visible work approves it for themselves, and there is no pending state for
anyone to act on.
