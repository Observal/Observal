    Best-effort warm-up only. Correctness never depends on this job: a stale
    or missing profile is rebuilt lazily on first request, and a user skipped
    here keeps an old ``computed_at`` so that lazy path still fires. It exists
    so the registry home page rarely pays for an analytics scan.

    Cost scales with *active* users, not registered ones. One query collects
    everyone with a session in the window, so an idle account costs nothing
    instead of a round trip to discover it has no sessions. If that lookup
    fails the sweep falls back to trying every user — degraded, not silently
    disabled.
