"""Kiro harness hook specification for session JSONL push.

Two hook formats exist, and Observal has to speak both:

* **Standalone v1 files** (``.kiro/hooks/*.json``) — introduced in Kiro IDE 1.0
  and CLI 3.0, read by *every* Kiro surface. Triggers are PascalCase.
* **Inline agent hooks** (``hooks`` inside ``.kiro/agents/<name>.json``) — the
  CLI 2.x format. Kiro IDE 1.0 loads such an agent normally but never fires the
  hooks, so the agent is visible and silent.

Observal therefore writes the standalone file by default and only falls back to
inline hooks when the machine has a legacy CLI 2.x and no IDE to read them.

What *does* hide an agent from the IDE picker is unrelated to hooks: see
:func:`observal_cli.harness.kiro.strip_ide_hostile_fields`.

Only 2 events are needed either way: prompt submit and stop (the push reads the
session JSONL incrementally).
