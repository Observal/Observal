"""How hook and MCP launchers start ``python <isolation> -m observal_cli.<module>``.

Launchers run in another process, usually from a project directory, with an
environment the CLI does not control, so importability is checked the way
they will run. The CLI's own process is not a guide: it may import
``observal_cli`` only through its working directory or ``PYTHONPATH``.

Nothing outside the interpreter's own installation, or the trusted package
root, may supply ``observal_cli``:

* Installed (imports in an isolated interpreter): launch with ``-I``. That
  ignores every ``PYTHON*`` variable, including an inherited ``PYTHONPATH``,
  skips user site-packages and keeps the working directory off ``sys.path``,
  which is the environment the check verified.
* Source checkout: launch with ``-P`` (no working directory) and an explicit
  ``PYTHONPATH`` set to the package root, which replaces rather than extends
  any inherited value.

The same rule applies to the CLI's own child processes (:func:`module_subprocess`),
which inherit the caller's working directory, often a project.
